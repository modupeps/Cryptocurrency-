Cryptocurrency as an investment: A bubble or the future of finance?
CRYPTOCURRENCY AS AN INVESTMENT: A BUBBLE OR
THE FUTURE OF FINANCE.
The rise of cryptocurrency has sparked global debates on its long-term
viability as an investment. Some experts argue that it is merely a
speculative bubble, similar to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, while
others believe it represents the future of finance. The volatility of digital
currencies, regulatory uncertainties, and the lack of intrinsic value in
some assets fuel concerns about their sustainability. However,
proponents highlight the decentralization, security, and potential to
revolutionize global transactions as evidence of their longevity. This
paper examines whether cryptocurrency is a speculative bubble or a
fundamental shift in the financial landscape.
Understanding Cryptocurrency.
Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that utilizes cryptographic
techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new units.
Unlike traditional currencies, most cryptocurrencies operate on
decentralized blockchain networks rather than being issued by central
banks. Bitcoin, created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, was the first
cryptocurrency and remains the most prominent (Nakamoto,2008) .1
Since then, thousands of digital assets, including Ethereum, Binance
Coin, and Solana, have emerged, each with unique functionalities.
The primary appeal of cryptocurrencies lies in their decentralization.
Blockchain technology enables peer-to-peer transactions without
intermediaries, reducing transaction costs and increasing efficiency.

Smart contracts, pioneered by Ethereum, allow for automated, self-
executing agreements that further enhance blockchain applications
beyond simple currency transfers. However, these innovations come
with risks, including security vulnerabilities, regulatory scrutiny, and
speculative behavior.
Cryptocurrency as a Speculative Bubble
A financial bubble occurs when asset prices significantly exceed their
intrinsic value, driven by speculative demand rather than fundamentals
(Kindleberger, 2011).2 Critics argue that cryptocurrency exhibits many
characteristics of a speculative bubble:
 Extreme V olatility
One defining feature of cryptocurrencies is their price volatility. Bitcoin,
for instance, surged from under $1,000 in early 2017 to nearly $20,000
by December of that year, only to crash below $4,000 in 2018 (Yermack,
2018).3 Similar boom-and-bust cycles have been observed in other
digital assets, making it difficult to classify cryptocurrencies as stable
investments. Unlike traditional financial instruments, which derive value
from earnings, cash flows, or economic indicators, cryptocurrencies
often rely on market sentiment and speculation.
 Lack of Intrinsic Value
Unlike stocks, which represent ownership in a company, or bonds, which
provide interest payments, cryptocurrencies do not generate cash flow or

dividends. Their value is primarily based on supply and demand
dynamics rather than tangible fundamentals (Cheah,2015).4 Some
economists compare Bitcoin to the Dutch tulip mania of the 17th
century, arguing that the rush to acquire cryptocurrencies is driven more
by hype than economic utility.
 Regulatory Risks
Governments worldwide are struggling to regulate cryptocurrencies,
given their decentralized nature. Some countries, such as China, have
banned cryptocurrency trading and mining, citing concerns about
financial stability and illicit transactions. In the United States, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken legal actions
against crypto firms for offering unregistered securities. The uncertainty
surrounding future regulations poses significant risks to investors, as
stringent policies could limit adoption and impact prices.
Cryptocurrency as the Future of Finance
Despite concerns about volatility and speculation, many experts argue
that cryptocurrency represents a fundamental shift in financial systems.
Several factors support this perspective:
 Decentralization and Financial Inclusion
One of the most compelling arguments for cryptocurrency’s longevity is
its ability to provide financial services to the unbanked population.
Traditional banking systems often exclude individuals in developing
nations due to high costs and regulatory barriers. Cryptocurrencies, on
the other hand, allow anyone with an internet connection to participate
in financial transactions without relying on centralized institutions. This

fundamental value of Bitcoin. Economic Letters,130, 32-36.
has led to increased adoption in countries with unstable financial
systems, such as Venezuela and Nigeria, where people use digital
currencies to hedge against inflation.
 Blockchain Technology and Security
Blockchain technology underpins cryptocurrencies and offers a secure,
transparent, and tamper-resistant ledger system. Unlike centralized
databases, which are vulnerable to hacks and fraud, blockchain networks
rely on cryptographic security and distributed consensus mechanisms.
This has led to the development of decentralized finance (DeFi)
applications, which provide banking, lending, and investment services
without intermediaries (Werbach,2018).5 The rapid growth of DeFi
platforms highlights the potential for blockchain to transform financial
services.
Institutional Adoption
Initially dismissed by traditional financial institutions, cryptocurrencies
are now being embraced by major corporations and investment firms.
Companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy have allocated portions of their
balance sheets to Bitcoin, signaling confidence in its long-term value. In
addition, global payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard are
integrating cryptocurrency transactions, further legitimizing digital
assets in mainstream finance. The introduction of Bitcoin exchange-
traded funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions provides investors with
regulated access to the asset class, reducing barriers to entry.
Comparing Cryptocurrency to Traditional Investments

To determine whether cryptocurrency is a bubble or a sustainable
investment, it is essential to compare it to traditional asset classes.
 Cryptocurrency vs. Stocks
Stocks represent ownership in a company and derive value from
earnings, assets, and market performance. While stock prices can be
volatile, they generally reflect a company’s financial health.
Cryptocurrencies, in contrast, lack underlying earnings, making their
valuations more speculative. However, some argue that Bitcoin
functions as “digital gold,” serving as a store of value rather than a
revenue-generating asset (Bouri et al, 2017).6
 Cryptocurrency vs. Gold
Gold has been a reliable store of value for centuries due to its scarcity,
durability, and acceptance as a hedge against inflation. Bitcoin shares
some similarities with gold, as it has a limited supply of 21 million coins
and is not controlled by any government. However, gold has intrinsic
industrial and jewelry demand, while Bitcoin’s value is based purely on
digital scarcity and adoption. Critics argue that unlike gold,
cryptocurrencies remain highly speculative and unproven as long-term
stores of value.
 Cryptocurrency vs. Real Estate
Real estate investments offer tangible assets with inherent value,
including rental income and property appreciation. Cryptocurrencies, on

the other hand, do not provide income streams and rely on market
perception for valuation. However, tokenized real estate—where
properties are represented as blockchain-based digital
tokens—demonstrates how cryptocurrency technology can enhance
traditional asset ownership and liquidity.
Future Outlook
The future of cryptocurrency depends on several factors, including
technological advancements, regulatory developments, and market
adoption. While speculative bubbles may arise within the crypto market,
the underlying blockchain technology is likely to persist. Innovations
such as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and smart contract
applications suggest that cryptocurrencies will continue to evolve and
integrate with global financial systems.
Potential Risk Areas
Despite its growing adoption, cryptocurrency faces several risks that
could impact its long-term sustainability as an investment and financial
instrument. These challenges range from regulatory uncertainties to
security vulnerabilities and environmental concerns.
1. Regulatory Crackdowns
Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate
cryptocurrencies. The decentralized nature of digital assets makes them
difficult to monitor, raising concerns about illicit activities such as
money laundering, tax evasion, and fraud. Countries like China have
imposed outright bans on crypto trading and mining, while the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has increased scrutiny of
crypto firms, leading to lawsuits against major exchanges such as
Binance and Coinbase. Stricter regulations could deter institutional
investors and limit adoption, making the future of cryptocurrency
heavily dependent on evolving legal frameworks.
2. Security Threats and Fraud
The digital nature of cryptocurrencies exposes them to significant
security threats. While blockchain technology itself is considered secure,
crypto exchanges, wallets, and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms
are frequent targets of cyberattacks. High-profile hacks, such as the $600
million Poly Network breach and the collapse of FTX due to
mismanagement and fraud, have raised concerns about investor
protection. Additionally, the prevalence of scams, rug pulls, and Ponzi
schemes in the crypto space further erodes public trust.
3. Market V olatility and Speculation
Cryptocurrencies are among the most volatile asset classes, experiencing
rapid price swings within short periods. For instance, Bitcoin surged to
nearly $69,000 in November 2021 before crashing to under $20,000 in
2022. Such unpredictability discourages risk-averse investors and
prevents cryptocurrencies from functioning as stable stores of value. The
lack of traditional valuation metrics, such as earnings or cash flow,
makes crypto prices heavily reliant on market sentiment and speculative
trading.
4. Scalability and Energy Consumption
Many blockchain networks, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, struggle
with scalability issues. Bitcoin’s network processes only around 7
transactions per second, compared to Visa’s 24,000 transactions per
second, making it inefficient for large-scale adoption. Although
Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) in 2022 significantly
reduced its energy consumption, Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW)
mechanism remains energy-intensive. Critics argue that the
environmental impact of crypto mining, which relies on vast amounts of
electricity, could lead to stricter regulations and reduced adoption.
5. Lack of Consumer Protection and Insurance
Unlike traditional banks, crypto wallets and exchanges do not offer
consumer protection measures such as deposit insurance. If an exchange
is hacked or goes bankrupt, investors often lose their funds with no legal
recourse. The collapse of platforms like Mt. Gox and FTX, which
collectively lost billions in customer assets, underscores the need for
stronger regulatory oversight and investor safeguards.
Potential Growth Areas
Despite these challenges, cryptocurrency continues to evolve, with
emerging trends signaling potential growth and long-term sustainability.
1. Integration with Traditional Finance
Institutional adoption is a key driver of cryptocurrency’s legitimacy.
Major financial institutions, including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and
Fidelity, have launched cryptocurrency investment products and trading
services. The approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in
jurisdictions like the U.S. and Canada has made it easier for institutional
investors to gain exposure to digital assets. Additionally, central banks
are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), which could
bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology.
2. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Smart Contracts
DeFi is revolutionizing the financial sector by offering blockchain-based
lending, borrowing, and trading services without intermediaries.
Platforms like Aave, Uniswap, and Compound allow users to earn
interest on crypto holdings, bypassing traditional banks. Smart contracts,
which execute automatically when predefined conditions are met, have
the potential to streamline industries beyond finance, including real
estate, insurance, and supply chain management.
3. Mainstream Adoption and Corporate Investment
Cryptocurrency is increasingly being integrated into everyday
transactions. Companies like Tesla, Microsoft, and Starbucks accept
Bitcoin and other digital assets as payment. Payment processors Visa
and Mastercard have developed crypto-linked debit cards, enabling
seamless spending. In emerging markets, cryptocurrencies provide
financial access to the unbanked, with countries like El Salvador
adopting Bitcoin as legal tender.
4. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and the Metaverse
Beyond finance, blockchain technology is driving innovation in digital
ownership and entertainment. NFTs allow artists, musicians, and content
creators to monetize their work on platforms like OpenSea and Rarible.
The metaverse, championed by companies like Meta (formerly
Facebook), is expected to integrate cryptocurrencies for digital
transactions, virtual real estate, and gaming economies.
5. Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Solutions
To address concerns about scalability and environmental impact, newer
blockchain projects are developing layer-2 scaling solutions (e.g.,
Lightning Network for Bitcoin, Optimistic Rollups for Ethereum).
Energy-efficient blockchains like Solana, Avalanche, and Algorand offer
faster transactions with lower costs, making them viable alternatives to
older networks. If these improvements continue, cryptocurrency could
become a mainstream financial tool with real-world utility.
Conclusion
While cryptocurrency faces regulatory, security, and volatility
challenges, its rapid adoption and technological innovations indicate
long-term potential. Whether crypto is a speculative bubble or the future
of finance will depend on regulatory clarity, security enhancements, and
real-world applications. Investors must navigate risks carefully while
considering the growing integration of digital assets into global financial
systems.
